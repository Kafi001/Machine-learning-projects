This document provides an overview of the code files and their purposes. The notebook is organized into sections that facilitate a structured approach to data analysis and modeling.

Code Sections-

1. Importing Necessary Libraries  
   Initializes the environment by importing libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. Loading the Dataset  
   Reads the dataset into the workspace and prepares it for further analysis.

3. Dataset Shape Check  
   Verifies the number of rows and columns in the dataset for initial understanding.

4. Summary Statistics  
   Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns.

5. Visualization Libraries  
   Imports additional libraries for data visualization.

6. Histograms for Numerical Features  
   Plots histograms to explore the distributions of numerical data.

7. Count Plots for Categorical Variables  
   Visualizes the frequency of categories in categorical features.

8. Categorical Column Check  
   Lists the column names to identify categorical variables.

9. Standardizing Numerical Features  
   Applies standardization to numerical features for consistency.

10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
    Reduces the dimensions of numerical data, retaining at least 7 components.

11. Random Forest Parameter Grid  
    Defines a hyperparameter grid for Random Forest, including regularization settings.

12. Feature Importance Plot  
    Visualizes the importance of features in the Random Forest model.

13. Logistic Regression Parameter Grid  
    Defines hyperparameters for Logistic Regression with regularization.

14. Cross-Validation for Random Forest  
    Performs cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.

15. Model Evaluation Function  
    A reusable function to compute and display model evaluation metrics.

16. Logistic Regression Evaluation  
    Evaluates Logistic Regression performance using PCA-transformed data.

17. ROC Curve and AUC  
    Imports libraries to calculate and visualize the ROC curve and compute the AUC score.

18. Comparative Metrics Table  
    Generates a comparison of metrics across different models.


Purpose-

This notebook performs a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. It focuses on Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, assessing their performance with and without PCA transformations.
