## Projects Overview

### Customer Purchase Prediction (Classification)
- Built supervised learning models to predict customer purchase behavior.
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- Achieved classification accuracy above 90% through feature selection and tuning.

### Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- Applied unsupervised learning to group customers based on purchasing patterns.
- Used K-Means and DBSCAN with PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- Identified meaningful customer segments for targeted analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)
- Performed sentiment classification on customer reviews.
- Used TF-IDF feature extraction with Naive Bayes and SVM models.
- Achieved high sentiment classification accuracy with interpretable results.

### Income & Student Performance Prediction
- Predicted income level and student performance using demographic and academic data.
- Focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and supervised modeling.
