This document provides an overview of the code files and their purposes. The notebook is organized into sections that facilitate a structured approach to clustering and analysis.

Code Sections-

1. Importing Necessary Libraries  
   Initializes the environment by importing libraries for data manipulation, clustering, and visualization.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   Analyzes the dataset, uncovering distributions and relationships among features.

3. Visualizing Distributions and Relationships  
   Creates visual representations of feature distributions and inter-feature relationships.

4. Correlation Matrix  
   Calculates and visualizes feature correlations to identify relationships.

5. Preprocessing the Dataset  
   Applies normalization techniques to scale the data for clustering.

6. KMeans Clustering  
   Implements the KMeans clustering algorithm with default parameters.

7. KMeans with k=4  
   Runs the KMeans clustering algorithm, specifying 4 clusters.

8. Silhouette Score for Clustering  
   Computes the Silhouette Score to evaluate clustering performance.

9. DBSCAN Clustering  
   Implements the DBSCAN clustering algorithm for density-based clustering.

10. Silhouette Score for DBSCAN  
    Evaluates the DBSCAN clustering using the Silhouette Score.

11. Cluster Comparison  
    Compares the clustering results of KMeans (k=4) and DBSCAN.

Purpose

This notebook explores clustering techniques on the dataset. It uses KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms, evaluates their performance with metrics like the Silhouette Score, and compares their clustering results.
